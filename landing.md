# Harmonic Systems Studio

## An Analog Practice for Digital Times

Welcome. I'm David, and I guide musical exploration through the lens of resonance, relationship, and regulation.

## The Practice

Like yoga for the musical mind, we gather in small groups or individually to explore sound as a living system. No performance anxiety, no recitals, no gold stars. Instead, we investigate:

- **Consonance & Dissonance** - The mathematics and feeling of intervals, how frequencies dance together or push apart
- **Folk Traditions** - Songs and stories that have survived generations, carrying cultural DNA in their melodies
- **Synthesis & Signal** - Building sounds from scratch, understanding oscillators and filters as tools for shaping vibration
- **Instrumental Families** - Euro-American instruments, world music traditions, found sounds, and the voice as our first instrument
- **Interactive Music Time** - Structured improvisation, call-and-response, and the social physics of making music together

### Two Paths, One Philosophy

**Independent Sessions**: Drop in when you can. Each gathering is complete in itself - explore tambura drones one week, Appalachian ballads the next.

**Incremental Journeys**: Commit to a season of exploration with a consistent group. Build from fundamental frequencies through cultural applications. Create something together.

## Cultural Competence & Inclusion

This practice emerges from:

- Training as a Speech-Language Pathologist specializing in AAC and autism support
- Years developing culturally inclusive communication systems with thousands of diverse images
- Direct experience supporting K-5 students across neurotypes and cultural backgrounds
- Recognition that musical traditions carry both beauty and historical complexity

**We acknowledge**: Every musical tradition exists within a cultural context. We approach all traditions with respect, cite our sources, and recognize when we are guests in another culture's sonic landscape.

**We center**: Neurodivergent ways of experiencing sound. Stimming is welcome. Silence is valid. Processing time is built in. Sensory needs are accommodated without question.

**We provide**: Multiple ways to engage. Visual frequencies displays for those who think in patterns. Embodied exercises for kinesthetic learners. Technical explanations for systematic minds. Stories and metaphors for narrative thinkers.

## Core Values

### Analog First, Digital When Helpful
Real instruments in real rooms with real people. Technology serves the experience, never dominates it. We might use an app to visualize harmonics, but our primary interface is ear-to-air.

### Process Over Product
Music as practice, not performance. Like meditation, the value is in the doing, not in achieving some external standard of "good."

### Regulation Through Resonance
Sound as a tool for nervous system support. Not music therapy (that's a clinical service), but musical experiences that naturally support equilibrium. Based on measurable phenomena - frequency ratios, rhythmic entrainment, harmonic series - not mystical claims.

### Transparent Complexity
Music theory isn't gatekept here. If you want to understand why a perfect fifth feels stable, we'll explore the 3:2 frequency ratio. If you prefer to just feel it in your bones, that's equally valid. Complex ideas, accessible explanations.

### Living Traditions
Folk music isn't museum pieces - it's living culture. We learn songs not to preserve them in amber but to understand how musical DNA evolves, adapts, and stays relevant across generations.

## Who This Is For

- **Parents** seeking screen-free enrichment that actually engages
- **Neurodivergent adults** wanting musical exploration without performance pressure
- **Technical minds** curious about the physics and mathematics of music
- **Cultural practitioners** looking to understand music beyond Western classical traditions
- **Burnt-out professionals** seeking analog practices that restore rather than deplete
- **Curious beginners** who've always wanted to understand music but felt excluded by traditional lessons

## The Guide

I bring an unusual combination: 
- M.S. in Communication Disorders with specialization in voice and AAC
- Multi-instrumentalist (piano, guitar, accordion, banjo)
- Former IBM Cloud Garage developer 
- Philosophy student since age 16
- Parent navigating the same screen-time challenges you face

This isn't about my expertise - it's about creating conditions where your own musical intuition can emerge and develop. I'm more facilitator than teacher, more guide than guru.

## The Invitation

Musical understanding is your birthright. Not everyone needs to be a performer, but everyone deserves to understand how sound works, why certain combinations move us, and how different cultures have solved the puzzle of organizing vibration into meaning.

Join us in person for sessions, house concerts, and workshops. The digital infrastructure exists only to support our analog practice - registration, resources, recordings for practice between sessions.

This is slow tech for deep learning. Harmonic systems for human nervous systems.

*Begin when you're ready. There's no behind to be.*
