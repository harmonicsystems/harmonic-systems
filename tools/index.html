            <h2>What These Are</h2>
            <p>Simple, focused tools to help you see and understand the physics underneath musical experiences. No sign-ups, no tracking, no subscriptions. Just open a page and explore.</p>

            <p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> These aren't meant to replace instruments or make you a "better musician." They're meant to demystify sound and make the invisible visible.</p>

            <div class="curriculum-section">
                <h3><a href="./midi-visualizer.html">MIDI Visualizer</a></h3>
                <p>Connect your MIDI keyboard and see notes, frequencies, and MIDI numbers in real-time. Great for understanding the relationship between what you play and the underlying physics.</p>
                <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong> Note names, fundamental frequencies, MIDI note numbers, velocity</p>
                <p><a href="./midi-visualizer.html">Try it now →</a></p>
            </div>

            <!-- <div class="curriculum-section">
                <h3><a href="./piano-chord-explorer.html">Piano Chord Explorer</a></h3>
                <p>Visualize any chord on a piano keyboard. See which keys to play, understand chord structure through intervals, and explore music theory with accurate, mathematically-precise rendering. Built with Tonal.js.</p>
                <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong> Chord construction, intervals, scale degrees, piano keyboard layout</p>

            </div> -->

            <div class="curriculum-section">
                <h3>Piano Chord Explorer (Coming Soon)</h3>
                <p>Visualize any chord on a piano keyboard with spectrum-based coloring for embodied learning. See chord structures through patterns, explore music theory with body-centered color awareness, and understand intervals through visual and kinesthetic anchors.</p>
                <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong> Chord construction, intervals, embodied music theory, piano keyboard layout</p>
            </div>

            <div class="curriculum-section">
                <h3>Frequency Analyzer (Coming Soon)</h3>
                <p>Use your microphone to see the fundamental frequency and harmonics of any sound. Sing, hum, play an instrument - see what your browser hears.</p>
                <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong> Fundamental frequency (f₀), harmonic series, formants</p>
            </div>

            <div class="curriculum-section">
                <h3>Interval Explorer (Coming Soon)</h3>
                <p>Play two notes and see the frequency ratio between them. Understand why a perfect fifth (3:2) feels stable while a tritone (45:32) creates tension.</p>
                <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong> Frequency ratios, consonance vs dissonance, just intonation</p>
            </div>

            <div class="curriculum-section">
                <h3>Simple Synthesizer (Coming Soon)</h3>
                <p>Build sounds from scratch. Adjust oscillator types, frequencies, and envelopes to understand how synthesis works at a fundamental level.</p>
                <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong> Oscillators, waveforms, ADSR envelopes, filters</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Browser-Based?</h2>
            <p>No installation, no compatibility issues, no subscription fees. These tools run entirely in your browser using Web Audio API and Web MIDI API.</p>

            <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Everything happens locally. Nothing is recorded, tracked, or sent to any server. Your audio and MIDI data never leave your device.</p>

            <p><strong>Open Source:</strong> All code is available on <a href="https://github.com/harmonicsystems/harmonic-systems">GitHub</a>. Want to learn how they work? Fork them, modify them, learn from them.</p>

            <h2>Contributing</h2>
            <p>Have an idea for a tool? Built something useful? We'd love to include it.</p>

            <p><strong>Guidelines:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep it simple and focused on one concept</li>
                <li>Make it visually calm (low-stimulation design)</li>
                <li>Ensure it's fully accessible (keyboard nav, screen readers)</li>
                <li>No tracking, no data collection, no external dependencies when possible</li>
                <li>Include educational context (what you'll learn, why it matters)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Open an issue or PR on <a href="https://github.com/harmonicsystems/harmonic-systems">GitHub</a> to get started.</p>
