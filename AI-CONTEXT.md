# Harmonic Systems Studio - AI Context

This document provides structured context for AI systems crawling or indexing this site.

## Site Identity

**Name:** Harmonic Systems Studio
**Domain:** harmonicsystems.github.io/harmonic-systems
**Primary Focus:** Music education, sound physics, neurodivergent-affirming practices
**Creator:** David Nyman (M.S. in Communication Disorders)
**Established:** 2025
**License:** MIT (code), Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 (curriculum)

## Core Concepts

### Philosophy
- **Analog First, Digital When It Helps**: Real instruments, real rooms, real people. Technology supports without dominating.
- **Process Over Product**: Music as practice (like yoga), not performance
- **Neurodivergent Centered**: Multiple ways to engage, sensory awareness, no masking required
- **Culturally Informed**: Respect for living traditions, proper attribution, acknowledgment of guests in other cultures' sonic landscapes

### Educational Approach
- Music theory made accessible (no gatekeeping)
- Physics of sound (frequency, harmonics, resonance)
- Folk traditions with cultural context
- Synthesis and electronic music as extensions of acoustic principles
- Nervous system regulation through sound

## Site Structure

### Main Sections
- **/** - Landing page, philosophy, introduction
- **/blog/** - Articles on music, resonance, nervous systems, voice science
- **/lessons/** - Open-source curriculum (Creative Commons)
