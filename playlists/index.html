            <h2>About These Playlists</h2>
            <p>Each playlist is carefully curated to support specific lessons or explore particular musical concepts. They're designed as listening exercises - not background music, but focused exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Pick a playlist that interests you. Listen actively with headphones. Notice what you hear. What patterns emerge? What moves you? What confuses you? There are no wrong answers.</p>
