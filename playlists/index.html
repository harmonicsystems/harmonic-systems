            <h2>About These Playlists</h2>
            <p>Each playlist is carefully curated to support specific lessons or explore particular musical concepts. They're designed as listening exercises - not background music, but focused exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Pick a playlist that interests you. Listen actively with headphones. Notice what you hear. What patterns emerge? What moves you? What confuses you? There are no wrong answers.</p>

                    <p>A case study in how songs travel, transform, and sometimes get stolen across cultures.</p>

                <h4>The Story</h4>
                <p>In 1939, Solomon Linda walked into a Johannesburg recording studio with his group, the Evening Birds. They were migrant workers who sang a cappella in the evenings. Without rehearsal, in three takes, they recorded "Mbube" (Zulu for "lion"). Linda's soaring falsetto over a repeating bass pattern created something that fused traditional Zulu musical elements with Western harmony. It became one of the first African recordings to sell over 100,000 copies.</p>

                <p>Linda sold his rights to the song for ten shillings (about $70 in today's money). He couldn't read and had no understanding of royalties. He became a local legend in the Zulu community but lived in poverty.</p>

                <p><strong>1951 - Wimoweh:</strong> Pete Seeger of The Weavers came across the recording and was fascinated. He transcribed it by ear, mishearing the Zulu "uyimbube" as "wimoweh." The Weavers released their version, crediting it as "traditional" and assuming Linda was long dead. It reached No. 6 on the US charts. Linda received nothing.</p>

                <p><strong>1961 - The Lion Sleeps Tonight:</strong> The Tokens, a doo-wop group from Brooklyn, asked songwriter George David Weiss to give "Wimoweh" English lyrics and a contemporary feel. He kept the chant, added 33 words ("In the jungle, the mighty jungle..."), and built the melody around Linda's final improvised notes from the original recording. It hit No. 1 and became a global phenomenon.</p>

                <p>Linda died in 1962 with about $40 in his bank account. His family couldn't afford a tombstone. Meanwhile, "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" was everywhere: over 150 cover versions, The Lion King, commercials, generating millions in royalties.</p>

                <p><strong>The Reckoning:</strong> In 2000, journalist Rian Malan exposed the story in Rolling Stone. In 2004, Linda's family (who were living in desperate poverty) sued Disney. They reached a settlement in 2006 that gave them back pay and a share of future royalties. Solomon Linda finally received co-writing credit.</p>

                <h4>Why This Matters Here</h4>
                <p>Folk songs do travel. Melodies cross borders, get reinterpreted, evolve. That's how music stays alive. But there's a difference between cultural exchange and cultural extraction.</p>

                <p>When Pete Seeger learned Linda wasn't dead and wasn't getting paid, he tried to redirect royalties. The system made it nearly impossible. When The Tokens added English lyrics, they genuinely thought they were adapting a traditional folk tune. Nobody checked. Nobody asked.</p>

                <p>This isn't about individual villains. It's about structures that made it easy for a Black South African musician to be erased from his own creation while white American musicians became millionaires from it.</p>

                <p>This playlist includes versions from across the decades so you can hear how the song changed—and think about what was gained, what was lost, and what should have been acknowledged from the start.</p>
