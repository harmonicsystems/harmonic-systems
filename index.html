            <h2>What We Do Here</h2>
            <p>Think of this like yoga for your ears and mind. We gather in small groups (or one-on-one) to explore how sound actually works - not to perform, but to understand and feel.</p>

            <p>Some things we explore together:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why certain notes feel stable together while others create tension</li>
                <li>Folk songs that have survived generations - what makes them stick?</li>
                <li>Building sounds from scratch with synthesizers (which are really just fancy vibrating machines)</li>
                <li>How different cultures organize sound into meaning</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="wave-break short-wave"></div>

            <h3>Two Ways to Show Up</h3>
            <p><strong>Drop-in sessions:</strong> Come when you can. Each gathering stands on its own. Maybe we're exploring drone instruments one week, Appalachian ballads the next.</p>

            <p><strong>8-week journeys:</strong> Commit to exploring with the same group over a season. We build from fundamentals through to making something together.</p>

            <h2>How This Space Works</h2>

            <p>This practice comes from my M.S. in Communication Disorders, years developing culturally inclusive communication systems, and working with people ages birth through 99 across neurotypes.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                Musical traditions carry both beauty and historical complexity. We approach each tradition with respect, cite our sources, and stay mindful when we're guests in another culture's sonic landscape.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Neurodivergent ways of experiencing sound are centered here.</strong> Stimming is welcome. Silence is valid. Processing time is built in. Sensory needs are met without having to explain or justify.</p>

            <p><strong>Multiple ways to engage:</strong> Visual frequency displays for pattern thinkers. Embodied exercises for kinesthetic learners. Technical explanations for systematic minds. Stories and metaphors for narrative thinkers. You choose what works for you.</p>

            <h2>What Guides This Practice</h2>

            <h3>Analog First, Digital When It Helps</h3>
            <p>Real instruments in real rooms with real people. Technology supports the experience without taking over. We might use an app to visualize harmonics, but the primary way we connect is ear-to-air, breath-to-breath.</p>

            <div class="wave-break"></div>

            <h3>Process Over Product</h3>
            <p>Music as practice, not performance. Like meditation or drawing, the value lives in the doing - not in meeting some external standard of "good enough."</p>

            <div class="wave-break"></div>

            <h3>Regulation Through Resonance</h3>
            <p>Sound can support nervous system equilibrium. This isn't music therapy (that's a clinical service with different training) - it's about musical experiences that naturally help us regulate. Based on observable phenomena like frequency ratios and rhythmic entrainment, not mystical claims.</p>

            <div class="wave-break"></div>

            <h3>Accessible Complexity</h3>
            <p>Music theory isn't locked away here. Want to understand why a perfect fifth feels stable? We'll explore the 3:2 frequency ratio. Prefer to just feel it in your bones? That works too. Complex ideas, but explained in ways that make sense.</p>

            <div class="wave-break"></div>

            <h3>Living Traditions</h3>
            <p>Folk music isn't museum pieces. It's living culture. We learn songs not to freeze them in time, but to understand how musical ideas evolve, adapt, and stay relevant across generations.</p>

            <h2>Who This Might Resonate With</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Parents looking for screen-free ways to engage with music and their kids</li>
                <li>Neurodivergent adults who want to explore music without performance pressure</li>
                <li>Technical minds curious about the physics and math underneath musical experiences</li>
                <li>Anyone wanting to understand music beyond Western classical traditions</li>
                <li>People seeking practices that restore rather than deplete</li>
                <li>Curious beginners who've felt excluded by traditional music lessons</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I bring a weird mix of experiences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>M.S. in Communication Disorders (specializing in voice and AAC)</li>
                <li>Multi-instrumentalist (piano, guitar, accordion, banjo)</li>
                <li>Trained in the IBM Cloud Garage Methodology</li>
                <li>Parent figuring out the same screen-time challenges everyone faces</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm less interested in being the expert and more interested in creating conditions where your own musical intuition can emerge. More facilitator than teacher. More guide than guru.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Invitation</h2>

            <p>Musical understanding belongs to everyone. Not everyone needs to perform, but everyone deserves to understand how sound works, why certain combinations move us, and how different cultures have organized vibration into meaning.</p>

            <p>Sessions happen in person. The digital stuff (this site, the blog, free curriculum) exists to support our analog practice - not replace it.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                This is slow tech for deep learning.<br>
