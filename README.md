# Harmonic Systems Studio

> Digital infrastructure for analog musical experiences

## What This Is

A unified platform supporting a new kind of musical practice - one that treats music like yoga: a practice of exploration rather than performance. Built by someone who is equally comfortable with synthesis parameters and speech pathology, with folk traditions and frequency analysis.

## Philosophy in Practice

**Analog First**: The apps support but never replace in-person gathering
**Low Stimulation**: Calm, focused interfaces that respect attention
**Culturally Informed**: Every tradition acknowledged with respect
**Neurodivergent Affirming**: Multiple ways to engage, sensory awareness
**Parent Friendly**: Understanding that kids might be present, schedules are hard

## Tech Stack (Recommended)

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom low-stim tokens
- **Audio**: Web Audio API + Tone.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Payments**: Stripe (sliding scale support)
- **Analytics**: Plausible (privacy-focused)

## Revenue Streams

1. **Session Fees**: $30-60 sliding scale per drop-in
2. **Incremental Journeys**: $200-400 for 8-week series
3. **House Concerts**: 10-20% platform fee
4. **Lullaby Lab**: $20/month subscription
5. **Corporate Workshops**: $500-1500 for team sessions

## Why This Matters

We're drowning in digital stimulation while starving for embodied experience. This practice offers a third way: using our technical powers to create spaces for analog connection. It's not anti-technology - it's technology in service of human resonance.
