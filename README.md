## What This Is

A unified platform supporting a new kind of musical practice - one that treats music like yoga: a practice of exploration rather than performance. Built by someone who is equally comfortable with synthesis parameters and communication disorders, with folk traditions and frequency analysis.

## Immediate Next Steps

### This Week
1. **Create GitHub repo**: `harmonic-systems`
2. **Deploy landing page**: Even just the markdown as HTML on Vercel
3. **Set up domain**: harmonic-systems.studio or similar
4. **Create booking form**: Simple Calendly or Google Form to start

### This Month
1. **Run pilot session**: Test the format with 2-3 friendly participants
2. **Document the experience**: What worked, what needs adjustment
3. **Begin house concert platform**: Simple Next.js app with Supabase
4. **Develop session materials**: First 4-week incremental journey

### This Quarter
1. **Launch public sessions**: Both independent and incremental tracks
2. **Ship house concerts MVP**: Get first event booked
3. **Begin lullaby lab prototype**: Leverage your FrequencyFinder code
4. **Establish pricing**: Test sliding scale model

## The Four Pillars (Apps)

### 1. Studio Web (Main Site)
- Landing page ✅ (we just wrote it!)
- Session calendar
- Resource library
- Booking system

### 2. House Concerts
- Host/artist matching
- Venue documentation
- Ticketing (or donation-based)
- Community building

### 3. Lullaby Lab (f₀)
- Frequency analysis for parent voices
- Custom lullaby generation
- Sleep pattern correlation
- Parent resource library

### 4. Folk Lineage
- Song documentation system
- Cultural context preservation
- Learning paths
- Attribution chains

### 5. Loop Builder
- Browser-based loop station
- Export to DAW
- Sharing/collaboration
- Teaching tool integration

## Philosophy in Practice

**Analog First**: The apps support but never replace in-person gathering
**Low Stimulation**: Calm, focused interfaces that respect attention
**Culturally Informed**: Every tradition acknowledged with respect
**Neurodivergent Affirming**: Multiple ways to engage, sensory awareness
**Parent Friendly**: Understanding that kids might be present, schedules are hard

## Tech Stack (Recommended)

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom low-stim tokens
- **Audio**: Web Audio API + Tone.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Payments**: Stripe (sliding scale support)
- **Analytics**: Plausible (privacy-focused)

## Revenue Model

1. **Session Fees**: Sliding scale for drop-in sessions
2. **Incremental Journeys**: Multi-week series with sustained engagement
3. **House Concerts**: Platform fee model
4. **Lullaby Lab**: Subscription-based access
5. **Corporate Workshops**: Custom pricing for team sessions

## Why This Matters

We're drowning in digital stimulation while starving for embodied experience. This practice offers a third way: using our technical powers to create spaces for analog connection. It's not anti-technology - it's technology in service of human resonance.

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal practice platform, but contributions are welcome! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

Key principles for contributors:
- Accessibility and neurodivergent-affirming design first
- Respect the analog-first philosophy
- Test on slow connections and low-end devices
- Document cultural sources and traditions
- Privacy-focused approaches (no tracking, no data mining)
